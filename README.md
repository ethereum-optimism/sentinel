# Sentinel

Sentinel is a tool for watching Redstone Data Availability and verifying proper behaviour of the DA provider.
Currently Sentinel can be used to help resolve challenges by providing the data onchain.
More features are to be added for challenging in case of missing data and locally backing up data during the
challenge window.
